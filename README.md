 Text_to_Image
 This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can transform natural language descriptions into visual images using deep learning. It bridges the gap between text and vision by generating images that match  user-provided prompts.
 Problem Statement:Creating images from text is a challenging task that requires understanding semantics, context, and visual composition. This project explores how neural networks can interpret descriptive text    and generate corresponding images, enabling applications in design, education, accessibility, and creative tools.
 Model Architecture- Uses a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion or DALL·E)
- Embeds text using a transformer-based encoder
- Generates images through iterative denoising steps
- Tech-Stack:- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Diffusers / OpenAI API (optional)
- Gradio (for web interface)
